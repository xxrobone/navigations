# navigations

## first one 
I took a challenge to try to create a function that 
takes in an array and creates a navigation (working) with one level

Then if the array object is an array that is a submenu, create a submenu from that array (working on)

## hamburger buttons
first one is done and its a nice regular hamburger with a transition animation, 3 lines to X 
this one works fine too
